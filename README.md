# 🧭 Life Path Simulator

**An interactive AI project that predicts life outcomes based on personal choices like age, sleep, and career.**

Built with synthetic (or optionally real) data, this project demonstrates how machine learning can model complex human factors like income, well-being, or future potential.

---

## 🚀 Demo Features

- 🎛️ Interactive sliders for life inputs (age, sleep, career)
- 📊 Real-time ML predictions (e.g., income)
- 🔄 Future-ready: add outcomes like happiness, relationships, education, etc.
- 🧪 Swappable backend (synthetic or IPUMS/Pew Research real-world data)
- 📱 Streamlit frontend or React prototype (in progress)

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- `Python`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn` – data + modeling
- `Streamlit` or `React` – frontend
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – data visualization

## ▶️ Run It Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/life-path-simulator.git
cd life-path-simulator
pip install -r requirements.txt
python generate_syn_data.py
python model_train.py
streamlit run app.py
````

## 📈 Example Inputs & Output

> **Inputs**:
>
> * Age: `30`
> * Sleep: `7.5 hours`
> * Career: `Engineer`

> **Output**:
> 💰 Predicted income: `$74,200`

---

## 🧠 Future Ideas

* Multi-outcome prediction (happiness, relationships, health)
* Real-time simulation of **life decisions over time**
* Reinforcement Learning life-planner bot
* Real-world integration with IPUMS or Pew datasets
